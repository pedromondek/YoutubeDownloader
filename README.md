# ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

### Installing dependencies

- First, install the Python dependencies. Before starting, make sure you have Python version **3.1x+** installed.
- The version tested by me was **v3.12.2**.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Then, install the PO-Token generator library using npm.

```bash
npm install:all
```

<br>

## Generating PO Token

This step is not essential, and it only needs to be done once. There are three options:

- Generate the PO Token using the potoken.js file (this may take a while or fail due to firewall blocks or network issues)

- Do it manually by following the steps found here: https://pytubefix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/po_token.html

_(Remember that you must be logged out when doing this manually, otherwise you risk getting your account banned)_

### Running without a PO Token

- In this third option, you must modify the following line _(ln 20, main.py)_:

From:

`yt = YouTube(link, use_po_token=True, on_progress_callback=on_progress)`

To:

`yt = YouTube(link, 'WEB', on_progress_callback=on_progress)`

### What are the disadvantages of running without a PO Token?

- Access will generate ads in the process, which may slow down downloads or even cause them to fail, especially when downloading playlists.
